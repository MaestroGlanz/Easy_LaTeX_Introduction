# Easy_LaTeX_Introduction

This is a short and easy introduction to LaTeX. It gives you a working document with all the explanation needed inside. From that on, you can work on your project, as you need it. If something is unclear, or you ran into difficulties with your project, then open an issue. This introduction should be enough, so that you can start on your own.

## Instruction
1. Download this repo by clicking download or using the command line command `git clone https://github/MaestroGlanz/Easy_LaTeX_Introduction.git /your/local/directory`
2. Download and install Texmaker
3. Only Windows: Download and install TeX-live or MikTeX. In Windows, I preferred the later. When prompted, choose "Install new packages automatically without prompting". The message might be worded a bit different, but you get the idea.
4. Start Texmaker
5. Open the BriefLatex.tex, if you are German, otherwise the LetterExample.tex
6. Read it from A to Z
7. Press F1 (quick build and view pdf) and see what happens. You might need several runs, as the compiler might discover another missing package after every run. After several tries, you should have all needed packages. Just watch the error messages, if the missing package changes on every run. If it does, you are good.

If there is anything unclear about this instruction, let me know. It should be all clear and you should be able to figure out the rest with a bit of googleing.
